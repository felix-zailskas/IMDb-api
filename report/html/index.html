      <section id="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="text">
          In this section we describe the feedback we got for each milestone and
          improvements we made based on that feedback. We have designed an Web
          application which allows the user to manipulate and view data from the
          IMDB movie dataset. Our application allows the user to use diverse
          tools which allow filtering of specific movies, actors, genres and
          also provide statistics for the movies. The user is able also able to
          manipulate data by adding, updating and deleting movies from the
          system.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="App_implementation">
        <h2>Application Implementation</h2>
        <p class="text">
          This section describes the set of instructions that a user needs to
          follow in order to run the current Web application. For the
          development of this application we have decided to go with the MEVN
          (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node) stack. We use MongoDB as a noSQL
          database since it allows us to manipulate collections of entities,
          which in our case are the movie, actors and genres. For the back-end
          framework we use Express because of it's accessible functionality. For
          the front-end part our decision was to use the Vue.js framework, since
          it allows a simple implementation of all the required functionality in
          comparison with Angular and React technologies. Since we are using
          java script for the back-end we also used the Node.js as the runtime
          environment and the npm (node packet manager) for handling all the
          node-modules that were required in the development/production version
          of the program. The communication between the client and the server is
          done via the concept of the REST API. This means that the server sends
          the user only the requested data and then the client side handles that
          information and displays it in a proper way. A further explanation
          about the models, API requests and UI implementation will be discussed
          in the following sections.
        </p>
        <h3>User requirements</h3>
        <p class="text">
          The following requirements were made for the application.<br />
          * It is worth to mention that the preparation of the data objects will
          be made on the back-end side of the web application and the front-end
          will deal only with the display of the obtained objects.
        </p>
        <ol id="ulUC">
          <li class="collection-item">
            Retrieve all actors in the dataset, optionally filtered by (full)
            name; In the case the user does not want to filter this is done with
            a GET request from the client to the server of the form /api/actor.
            Otherwise we use the the GET request of the form /api/actor/{name}.

            Retrieve all available information about a specific movie identified

            /api/movie/{URL} in the case if the user wants to identify the movie
            by URL. In the case the user wants to find the movie by it's title
            then the GET request of form /api/movie/{title}.

            Retrieve all movie genres for a specific actor or director,

            /api/genre/{name} with the corresponding query parameters. For the
            ascending/descending ordering we will have an additional query
            parameter which will indicate in which ordering
            the application should return the result. The User will be able to
            select a specific order by a using drop-down menu.

            server of the form /api/movie. To subset them, the desired
            specifications will be passed through query parameters.
